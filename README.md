# midwest_survey_models

A couple of quick models designed for the dataset midwest survey.

# How to

- Fork this repository.
- Clone it locally.
- Run `pixi install` to create a clean virtual environment.
- Run `pixi run convert-to-notebooks` if you prefer to work with notebooks rather than python files. 
- If you have too much trouble with pixi, you can use your usual virtual env system, and use the requirements.txt.
- Answer the questions below based on your exploration.
- Run `pixi run convert-to-python-files` if you worked in notebooks.
- Push your code and your answers to your fork.

# Steps of the tutorial

1. Look for a file called "security_breach.txt" in your computer. How was it created?
2. This file created is quite harmless; could you give an example of something that could have been done more harmful?
3. Implement a new way to safely share models (hint: check the library skops)

Once all these are done, you can continue to the third part of this guided work: prepare a presentation with your group.
